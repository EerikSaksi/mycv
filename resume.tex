\textbf{UROS} \hfill Oulu, Finland\\
\textit{Software Engineer} \hfill June 2019 - August 2019\\
\vspace{-1mm}
\begin{itemize} \itemsep 1pt
	\item I reverse engineering a project built with LabVIEW, a neural network written in C and an MYSQL database.
  \item I replaced LabVIEW and the C library with a singular Python project that used the existing MYSQL database.
  \item UROS could then use more modern data processing without losing backwards compatibility with existing customer data.

\header{Projects}
    {\textbf{Tune Type}} {\sl Sequelize, node.js, Express, Apollo Server, GraphQL, Google Oauth, React, Bootstrap} \hfill \url{tunety.pe}\\
With tunetype, you can select a song and practice your typing speed to the lyrics and song live. You can also create synchronizations for songs that haven\textquotesingle{}t been synchronized yet. I used YouTube\textquotesingle{}s and Genius\textquotesingle{}s API for searching and metadata. Hosted on Heroku.\\

    {\textbf{Collaborative Activity Tracker}} {\sl Expo, PostGraphile, Typescript, Postgres} \hfill \url{https://github.com/EerikSaksi/level_5_project}\\
As my level 4 project, I'm making a collaborative activity tracker, which should encourage users who are exercising together to be more motivated. It has RPG elements, where getting stronger and being consistent increases your characters and thus your teams damage per second, which allows you to progress to further stages. I am using Expo to make building and testing cross platform apps easier, and PostGraphile to efficiently and automatically build the GraphQL from a Postgres database.\\
\vspace*{2mm}
    {\textbf{vim-marks-overhaul}} {\sl Vimscript} \hfill \url{https://github.com/EerikSaksi/vim-marks-overhaul}\\
I am constantly trying to increase my workflow efficiency, going as far as to replace an entire feature in my text editor. This overhauls and extends on the marking used in Vim. I am also actively customizing my other tools as I work, such as my snippets and my shell \href{https://github.com/EerikSaksi/dotfiles}{(my configuration)}.   \\
